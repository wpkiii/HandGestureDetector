To run this just use python app.py

To be honest there were a few technical issues with mediapipe, opencv, and numpy. If you encounter these issues just make sure they are all on a compatible version.

This is still a work in progress, as my ultimate goal is just to combine the robotic hand with this. 

Hope you enjoy and message me if you have any quetisons.
